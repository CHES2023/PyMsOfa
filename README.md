This package is a Python wrapper for the Standards of Fundamental Astronomy (SOFA) service of the International Astronomical Union (IAU). It implements all 248 functions in a C file from the SOFA package.

This Python package can be suitable for the astrometric detection of habitable planets of the Closeby Habitable Exoplanet Survey (CHES) mission and for the frontier themes of black holes and dark matter related to astrometric calculations and other fields.
